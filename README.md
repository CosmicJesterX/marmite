# Marmite

[**Mar**kdown **M**akes s**ite**] is a **very!** simple static site generator.

## How it works

It does **"one"** simple thing only:

Reads all `.md` files on the `content` folder
Using `CommonMark` parse it to `HTML` content
Renders each content using templates from the `templates` folder
Outputs the rendered static site to the `site` folder.

## Installation

Install my-project with cargo

```bash
cargo install marmite
```

Or download the pre-built binary from the [releases]() page.



## Write the content

1. Initialize the project

This command creates the initial folder structure

```bash
marmite init myblog
```

Folder structure will be

```plain
myblog
├── marmite.yaml        # Site configuration
├── content
│   ├── about.md        # Page on the menu
│   └── first-post.md   # Post on the timeline
├── static
│   └── style.css       # Empty CSS
└── templates
    ├── base.html       # Common HTML
    ├── content.html    # Renders page and post
    └── list.html       # Renders index, tags, archive
```

2. Write the site data

`marmite.yaml`
```yaml
name: My Blog
tagline: This blog is awesome
url: https://www.myblog.com
pagination: 10
```

3. Write yout content

Drop an `.md` file on the `content/` folder.

**Pages vs Posts**

- Post: If it has a `date` property it is considered a post to show in the index posts list.
- Page: If it does not have a `date` it is considered a page to show in the menu.

**Metadatada**

Front matter is used in yaml format.

```
---
date: "2024-01-01"
title: Title
slug: title
tags: comma,separated,tags
show_in_menu: true
---

```

- **date**: If informed, the content is considered a `Post` and shows in index list.
- **title**: If not defined, the first line of the markdown content is used.
- **slug**: If not defined, the filename is used to build the url.
- **tags**: Optional
- **show_in_menu**: if content is a page (has no date) then it is added in the menu.


All fields are optional, if nothing is declared then the content is considered a `Page` that does't show in the listing, neither rss or menu. (useful for drafts, or pages accessible with link only.)


**Example Post**

`content/first-post.md`
````markdown
---
date: "2024-01-01"
title: My First Blog Post
slug: my-first-blog-post
tags: poetry,life
---

# Hello this is my first post

This blog was generated by `Marmite` the simplest static site generator

I can have local images as along as those are located on the `static` folder.

## Images

I can also have remote images

## Code Snippets

```python
de foo():
    return "bar"
```
````

### editors and deployment

Marmite does not come with an editor but as the content is simply markdown files, **any** text editor will work!

Generated site is pure HTML + CSS so it can be served on **any** static webserver.


Workflow is generally:

- Create a new `content/your-content-title.md`.
- Edit in your preferred **editor** (There are some with good preview support).
- Add the `date` metadata when it is ready to publish.
- commit to your preferred **repository**.
- use your preferred **automation system** to publish it to your preferred **web server**.

Common examples:

- Edit in **Marktext** Editor, configure it to move pasted images to `static/img`, commit to Github, Add an action to build and Publish as a Github Page.
- Edit directly in the Github Web UI, commit, let CI Action to build and publish.
- Edit in **vim**, Generate the site locally, Publish via FTP.
- Edit in **VsCode**, Commit to Git Repository, Have the CI to build and Publish (GH pages, netlify etc)

> Marmite focus on generating the site from markdown only, the deployment and media management is a separate problem to solve.



## That's all!

**Marmite** is very simple, and limited in functionality, there is no intention to add more features or built-in themes.

If this simplicity does not suit your needs, there are other awesome static site generators.


Here are some that I recommend:

- Cobalt
- Zola
