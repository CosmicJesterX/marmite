# Welcome to my blog

This is a blog post, there is no frontmatter defining the `date` metadata, 
usually on those cases `marmite` will render a simple page, not listed on the home page.

However in this case, the filename includes a date prefix `2024-10-19-new-post.md` 
so marmite considers it as a blog post because it was able to extract the date from the filename.

This is an opinionated decision of **marmite**  

if something has a date it is an article, a post, if does not have a date, then it is considered a simple page.
